 * GTK GUI program to correlate photos with GPS data.
 * Uses common parts of a command line version of the same.
 * Just this time, with a pretty GUI to make it all simple and easy. */

/* Although I did not start out with a clear idea of the contents
 * of this file, I had thought it would be a little more than a "stub"
 * to get the GUI up and running. However, this seems to work for me!
 * All the action really happens in gui.c. */
